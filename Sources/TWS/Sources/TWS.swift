/// A class that manages all communication between your app and the TWS portal. It handles the state and updates of snippets and provides various methods for interacting with the SDK.
///
/// ## Initialization
///
/// You can create an instance of the manager in two ways: either by using the ``TWSFactory/new(with:)-7y9q7`` or ``TWSFactory/new(with:)-7u4v8`` methods on the ``TWSFactory``. Alternatively, you can utilize SwiftUI View extensions, such as ``SwiftUICore/View/twsEnable(configuration:)`` or ``SwiftUICore/View/twsEnable(sharedSnippet:)``. These extensions internally create the manager using the factory and inject it into the view hierarchy.
///
/// > Note: You are responsible for keeping the instance alive. When using the SwiftUI extension, the instance will remain alive as long as the view is active.
///
/// ## Displaying Snippets
///
/// To iterate over and observe the snippets, use the ``TWSManager/snippets`` property. Leverage the ``TWSView`` to display them in your SwiftUI views.
///
/// ```swift
/// import SwiftUI
/// import TWS
///
/// struct HomeView: View {
///
///     @Environment(TWSManager.self) var tws
///
///     var  body: some View {
///         TabView {
///             ForEach(tws.snippets()) { snippet in
///                 TWSView(snippet: snippet)
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
